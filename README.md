# Tiny CS Projects

A collection of small code snippets, experiments, and learning exercises. This repo documents my journey as a long-term learner - exploring whatever catches my interest, from classic algorithms to weird experiments and WarCrimes to coding. No strict curriculum, just curiosity-driven learning. Some days it's data structures, other days it's random experiments that may or may not work. Feel free to add a review as comments in the files you like.
